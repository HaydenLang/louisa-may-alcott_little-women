<p>
"Go then, my little Book, and show to all<br />
That entertain and bid thee welcome shall,<br />
What thou dost keep close shut up in thy breast;<br />
And wish what thou dost show them may be blest<br />
To them for good, may make them choose to be<br />
Pilgrims better, by far, than thee or me.<br />
Tell them of Mercy; she is one<br />
Who early hath her pilgrimage begun.<br />
Yea, let young damsels learn of her to prize<br />
The world which is to come, and so be wise;<br />
For little tripping maids may follow God<br />
Along the ways which saintly feet have trod."</p>
